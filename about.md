This is a technical blog about the progress of Free Software I contribute to, mostly at [GNU.org](https://savannah.gnu.org/users/gary) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gvvaughan).

Comments are disabled to save you from digging through spam, but I still enjoy getting feedback via email, and usually respond within a day or two.
